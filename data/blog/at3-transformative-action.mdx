Equality is the right to have equal opportunities and access to resources, regardless of race, gender, religion, or any other characteristic and without any discrimination or prejudice. This is a crucial aspect of human rights and should be consistent all around the world but unfortunately, it isn't. Many countries still do not uphold this fundamental human right.

One country that seems to be stuck between supporting the rights of others is the United States. While the United States has made progress in supporting the rights of those who are marginalised, the Republican Party still seems to be stuck in the past. In May 2023, 70 anti-LGBTQ laws were enacted just that year. Including but not limited to:

- Laws banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth: 15
- Laws requiring or allowing misgendering of transgender students: 7
- Laws targeting drag performances: 2
- Laws creating a license to discriminate: 3
- Laws censoring school curriculum, including books: 4

The most aggressive states include Florida, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas _(Human Rights Campaign, 2023)_. All states are dominated by the Republican party _(Wikipedia; WiseVoter, 2023)_. An initiative that helps to fight against these injustices is the Human Rights Campaign which fights for the rights of LGBTQ people and people of colour.

If the Republican party wins the 2024 election, "Project 2025" will be launched to instate policies that will strip away the rights of LGBTQ people _(Thompson, Esseks and Cooper, 2024)_, as well as remove the independence of critical parts of the government like the FBI and DOJ _(Mystal, 2024)_. This will be done to ensure that the Republican party will remain the dominant party.

Unlike the United States, Australia has been progressing further to support the rights of those marginalised. Same-sex activity is allowed in all states of Australia and conversion theory is banned in the ACT, NSW, QLD, and VIC _(Acton, 2017; www.humanrights.unsw.edu.au, n.d.)_. Unfortunately, Australia is one of the few countries that support LGBTQ people.

## Religious Stats

While many believe that you cannot be religious while being gay, transgender, or any other term under the LGBTQ umbrella, this is untrue.
