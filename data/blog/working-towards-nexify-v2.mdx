Recently, I have regained access to the nexifyhub.com domain and the @NexifyHub Twitter handle. In this post, I want to talk about the possible future of the Nexify and NexifyHub brand. Any content that is in this blog post is subject to change and will most likely be changed for various reasons.

I want to make it clear that Nexify is unlikely to come back any time soon and could take up to 3 years before fully coming back. The Nexify and NexifyHub brand may be changed later on to reflect new changes to the site. Please be patient while we try to set the site up as best as we can.

## Here's the plan

I'll be addressing a whole bunch of stuff that needs to be done to ensure the success of Nexify v2. This post also includes any concerns or suggested features that I was notified of. To make it easier to read, I have separated all of the various topics into different sections.

### Closed Beta // Invite-only

To control the flow of new users, Nexify will start as a closed beta and invite-only. Every user will be allocated 2 invite codes that they can give out to other people wanting to sign up. Once the beta is over, the site will go public and users will be able to create an infinite amount of invite codes.

We understand people may be annoyed with the fact the site is closed beta. Our team has noticed this with the new social media platform Bluesky, founded by the ex-Twitter CEO. However, we want people to understand that if we don't do this, we won't be able to control the flow of new users causing the services to degrade.

### Staff Team

We'll have a staff team from day one, they'll be provided with the necessary resources and training. Our staff will not be able to view any information that isn't already publicly available on your profile as part of our security policies. Staff members will have to follow rules just like normal users have to.

### Verification

Just like other platforms, Nexify will incorporate verification systems into our platform. Verification will not be available for average users, instead, Nexify will be manually reviewing users before verifying them. We'll also build systems to allow users to submit applications for verification.

We offer two ways of being verified, one of them is manually reviewed by Nexify and the second one is available for all users but does not give you the verification badge. The available method is link verification, which is similar to other platforms. Once you verify a domain to your account, it can be used as a username alias.

We also have plans available for businesses. For a small fee, businesses will be able to get verified, and any linked accounts to a business will also get verified for an extra fee. This plan won't be available to normal users and you must have a valid Australian Business Number (or the equivalent for your country) as well as a business name.

### Transparency Reports

Nexify is dedicated to ensuring that we are 100% transparent with our users. At the end of every second month, we'll provide a transparency report with the following: the number of new users, suspended users, reports received, DMCA takedowns, legal requests, and the cost of all Nexify equipment.

### NSFW Content

Furthermore, we'll implement automatic detection for images and videos that will check for NSFW content and add a blur effect over the top of it. Birthdays will be enforced on the platform, We understand that minors can easily bypass this procedure by providing a fake birthday, but we have no control over this.

Accounts will be able to mark their whole account as NSFW which will prevent all posts from showing up in the timelines of people under the age of 18. Similar to what was mentioned before, when users who are under 18 try to visit an NSFW account, they'll be denied based on the birthday they provided.

### Artists on Nexify

We'll have features in place to protect any artists on Nexify. Any art that you own that is posted to Nexify is yours, we do not own it. We want to make it easier for artists to remove infringing content, Feel free to contact any of our staff members about content that has been stolen and isn't covered by fair use.

### Report System

The new report system will be improved from the last one. The new system will allow users to pick from a list of broken rules, or specify a custom one. This allows us to delegate reports for certain broken rules to specific moderators, this will protect our moderators who prefer to not see any NSFW content.

Similar to the NSFW content detection systems, we will implement systems that allow us to automatically process reports. This includes automatic denial, approval, and a feature that marks it as needing staff intervention. Hopefully, this system will allow moderators to spend less time reading reports.

### Apps

The original version of Nexify had no apps available. We understand that this may have been frustrating to some users, and we want to fix that. In version 2 of Nexify, we'll start rolling out a native app on the Google Play Store. Nexify v2 will not be released with an app on the Apple App Store until we have enough funds to cover the $100 yearly fee.

### Business Integrity

The identities of businesses on Nexify are critical and need to be protected. During Nexify v1, accounts were created with the sole purpose of mimicking brands and deceiving users. This is why Nexify v2 will implement policies to prevent this from happening again. We will be reserving usernames for businesses to prevent any bad actors from using them.

I want to make it clear, that parody accounts are still allowed. However, you are not allowed to mimic a brand in a way that deceives users into believing that the account is official. You must make it clear either in your about me, or username, that the account is a parody.

### Advertisements

Nexify will be using advertisements as its main source of income. Feel free to use an ad-block if you wish, we won't stop you. Advertisements run on the Nexify site will be run by other users and targeted towards specific groups of people. Our staff team will be checking all advertisements for any rule violations.

### Business Tools

Nexify v2 is going to be implementing various tools for businesses. We are planning to add a feature to automatically deploy accounts, which have verified status and are linked to the business. This feature will be useful for companies that have multiple services, e.g.: Nexify (primary), NexifyHelp, NexifyAds.

As mentioned earlier, we'll start reserving usernames so they can't be used for malicious purposes. One way to get these usernames is to contact support and provide proof of being the rightful owner. However, we have another way, As mentioned in the verification section, you can add a domain. Once added, the username will be available to that account.

### Donations/Subscription

We'll also accept donations or you can purchase an optional subscription. The available subscription will not give you any higher power than other users and is simply a donation every month. The subscription may be used to give donors early access to beta features. Feel free to cancel this subscription at any time, it is not required.

### Security

Our user's security is our number 1 priority. Sensitive information, such as your password, will be encrypted on our systems with a salt. Our staff team will not be able to tell you your password if you forget it, they'll only be able to provide you a password reset link that will automatically invalidate itself after an hour.

In addition to our system's security, we'll have security features for Nexify accounts. You'll be able to enable 2-factor authentication, we plan to support authenticator-based apps, Yubikeys, FIDO2 security keys, and more. We'll also add additional options that require anyone wanting to reset your password to provide the email.

### Nexit Context

Similar to other platforms, we'll introduce a community-oriented feature that allows users to add additional context to posts. This is useful for when a post is misleading but doesn't break any rules. Not all users will be eligible for this feature, however, everyone will be able to vote on whether the context is valid or not.

### Themes

Users will be able to create their own custom themes with automatic syncing to Nexify-related services, such as the apps for mobile. By default, users will have the option to switch between light and dark mode, however, we plan to let you be able to completely customise every aspect of the UI.

Nexify themes will always remain free, no matter what. We also plan to allow users to share their custom themes with other users on the site by posting a link to the theme. Themes will be just one of the many ways to customise Nexify to be unique to your own experience and liking.
